# Pangea Extensions for Firebase

This repository contains the source for Pangea Firebase Extensions. Created and tested by Pangea, these official Firebase extensions are reliable and secure. To learn more about Firebase Extensions, including how to install them in your Firebase projects, visit the Pangea [Firebase documentation](https://pangea.cloud/docs/tutorials/firebase/).

Each directory in this repo contains the source code for a Pangea service extension and a README to explain how the extension works, including information about the Pangea service, APIs enabled, resources created, and the access granted to the extension.

When you find an extension that solves a need for your app or project, all you do is install and configure the extension. With extensions, you don't spend time researching, writing, and debugging the code that implements functionality or automates a task for your app or project.
