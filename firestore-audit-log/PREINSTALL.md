Use this extension to securely log sensitive events using Pangea tamperproof Secure Audit Log service by writing log messages to a Cloud Firestore collection or by emitting an EventArc event.

This extension listens to your specified Cloud Firestore collection. If you add a string or event object map to a specified field in any document within that collection, this extension:

- Securely Logs the string or event using the Pangea Secure Audit Log service. Logs can later be viewed using the Pangea Dashboard [Secure Audit Log Viewer][].
- Hashes of each log entry will be recorded on a tamperproof blockchain and can be cryptographically verified for authenticity.

You can specify the desired metadata types in addition to the message for each log entry, such as, actor, action, source, target, and status. For more information on the Pangea Secure Audit Log service reference the [Documentation][].

If the original input field of the document is updated, a new log entry will be automatically created.

#### Logging messages (Firestore)

Each log is comprised of a set of fields designed to record specific components of the activity being recorded. The only required field is message, with all others being optional.

```js
getFirestore().collection("audit").add({
  log: "Record created",
});
```

#### Logging messages with optional metadata (Firestore)

To create an entry with optional metadata fields, store a map containing the optional fields as keys and values as strings.

```js
getFirestore()
  .collection("audit")
  .add({
    log: {
      message: "Record created with metadata",
      actor: "User 1",
      action: "Create",
      source: "Firebase client",
      target: "Database",
      status: "Completed",
    },
  });
```

#### Multiple log entries (Firestore)

To log multiple entries, store an array of either maps or strings:

```js
getFirestore()
  .collection("audit")
  .add({
    log: [
      {
        message: "First record created",
        actor: "User 1",
        action: "Create",
        source: "Firebase client",
        target: "Database",
        status: "Completed",
      },
      {
        message: "Second record created",
        actor: "User 1",
        action: "Create",
        source: "Firebase client",
        target: "Database",
        status: "Completed",
      },
      {
        message: "Third record created",
        actor: "User 1",
        action: "Create",
        source: "Firebase client",
        target: "Database",
        status: "Completed",
      },
    ],
  });
```

#### Logging messages (EventArc)

```js
getEventarc().channel().publish({
  type: "firebase.extensions.pangea-audit-log.v1.log",
  data: {
    message: "Record created with metadata",
    actor:  "User 1",
    action: "Create",
    source: "Firebase client",
    target: "Database",
    status: "Completed",
  }},
});
```

You can uninstall the extension that created the channel and all subsequent installs will continue to work.
